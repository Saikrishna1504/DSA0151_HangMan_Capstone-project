## About the Project
The **Hangman Game** is a simple console-based application where the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project is a part of the DSA0151 Object-Oriented Programming course, and it highlights the practical use of OOP principles in **C++**, such as classes, objects, and methods.

## Features
- Interactive word-guessing game.
- Simple, user-friendly console prompts.
- Tracks wins and losses.
- Random word selection for each round.
- Limited attempts to guess the correct word.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Used for both the backend logic and interface.

## How to Play
1. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
2. Players will be prompted to guess one letter at a time.
3. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s).
4. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player loses an attempt.
5. The game continues until the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
